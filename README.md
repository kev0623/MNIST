# MNIST Digit Classifier
<h2> Overview</h2>
This Jupyter Notebook (MNIST_Digit_Classifier.ipynb) demonstrates the process of building, training, and evaluating a deep learning model to classify handwritten digit images from 1 to 9 using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community and consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits.
